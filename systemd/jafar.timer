Description=Jafar Daily Run Timer (8am-8pm randomized)
Documentation=https://github.com/Telesphoreo/Jafar

[Timer]
# Explicitly specify which service to trigger
Unit=jafar.service

# Run every day at 2:00 PM (14:00) as the anchor time
OnCalendar=*-*-* 14:00:00

# Add ± 6 hours of randomization (8am-8pm window)
RandomizedDelaySec=21600

# If the system was off when the timer should have triggered, run it on next boot
Persistent=true

# WARNING: Single daily run can create gaps of up to 36 hours
# Example: Run at 8pm Monday, then 8am Wednesday = 36h gap
# Consider using jafar-morning.timer + jafar-evening.timer instead
# for better coverage (max 14h gap)
